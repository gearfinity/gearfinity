# Gearfinity Project

Welcome to Gearfinity, your playground for boundless mechanical creations! Gearfinity is a modular and extensible 3D printing project, functioning as a comprehensive engineering kit. With Gearfinity, you can assemble intricate, fully functional mechanical constructs entirely from 3D printed parts – bearings, fasteners, and all. Ready to gear up?

## Getting Started

Your journey into the Gearfinity universe begins with a few essential tools and resources. Here's what you'll need:

1. **A 3D printer**: The cornerstone of your Gearfinity creations.

2. **A hard, flat edge**: Something like a small flathead screwdriver or a knife will come in handy for separating parts.

3. **Wire cutters/snips or needle-nose pliers** (recommended): These tools will be useful for removing (and sometimes inserting) pins.

Once you're equipped, it's time to print your first tool: the [pin tool](LINK_TO_PIN_TOOL). This is our recommended device for inserting pins seamlessly.

Ready to get your hands dirty with your first module? Meet the [crank module](LINK_TO_CRANK_MODULE) – an excellent starting point for all aspiring Gearfinity builders.

Remember, patience is key when it comes to assembly. So, take your time, enjoy the process, and watch as your mechanical masterpiece comes to life!
