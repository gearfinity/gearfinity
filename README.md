# Gearfinity Project

Welcome to Gearfinity, your playground for boundless mechanical creations! Gearfinity is a modular and extensible 3D printing project, functioning as a comprehensive engineering kit. With Gearfinity, you can assemble intricate, fully functional mechanical constructs entirely from 3D printed parts – bearings, fasteners, and all. Ready to gear up?

## A Note from the Founder

(not interested? [skip ahead](#-getting-started) to get started 😉)

Since I was a kid I've always been fascinated with modular construction sets. From Tinker Toys and Lincoln Logs to Legos and K'nex, I would get lost in the [challenge of building and creating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3P41ri6QZ8). My passion for designing and building later led me into studying robotics and [founding a team to compete in the NASA Lunabotics competition](https://www.alabamaastrobotics.com/) (the team went on to win many years of the competition). Building lunar excavator prototypes introduced me to the power of planetary gears and modular design. Around 2014 I purchased my first 3D printer: the legendary Da Vinci 1.0. I immediately fell in love with 3D printing. In designing robots I had picked up some CAD skills, and now I could almost instantly bring my designs into reality. The possibilities truly seemed endless!

Five years later in 2019 I suddenly became inspired to try to design a 3D printable bubble machine for my kids. I knew I wanted to use planetary gears somehow so I dove into researching what others had designed. I found [lots of cool creations](#-acknowledgements), but all of them had something in common that bugged me: they all required extra (non-3D printed) parts. I LOVE the idea of bootstrapping a creation without any external dependencies (NASA calls this [In Situ Resource Utilization or ISRU](https://www.nasa.gov/isru/overview)), so pretty soon I was inspired to create my own 3D printable construction set combining my passion for my childhood toys with the knowledge I had gained from my years with robotics. Thus, Gearfinity was born!

It took a few years of iterating and tinkering but I'm proud to say the Bubble Machine Module is now a functioning reality! (Stay tuned for the official release 😉). Along the way I created several other fun "Modules" and had ideas for many more. I'm thrilled to finally share this project with the world and I hope you find it as fun, educational, and inspiring as I do. Thanks for joining me on this journey!

## 🚀 Getting Started

Your journey into the Gearfinity universe begins with a few essential tools and resources. Here's what you'll need:

1. **A 3D printer**: The cornerstone of your Gearfinity creations.

2. **A hard, flat edge**: Something like a small flathead screwdriver or a knife will come in handy for separating parts.

3. **Wire cutters/snips or needle-nose pliers** (recommended): These tools will be useful for removing (and sometimes inserting) pins.

Once you're equipped, it's time to print your first tool: the [pin tool](https://github.com/gearfinity/gearfinity/blob/main/tools/pin_tool.STL). This is our recommended device for inserting pins seamlessly.

In Gearfinity, a 'module' refers to a specific configuration of components that together form a fully functioning mechanism. Each module incorporates various Gearfinity parts (i.e. components) in a way that showcases a distinct mechanical function or interaction.

Ready to get your hands dirty with your first module? Meet the [crank module](https://github.com/gearfinity/gearfinity/blob/main/crank_module/README.md) – an excellent starting point for all aspiring Gearfinity builders. This module is meant to showcase some of the core features of Gearfinity in a simple way, so check it out!

Remember, patience is key when it comes to assembly. So, take your time, enjoy the process, and watch as your mechanical masterpiece comes to life!

## 🧩 Modularity

Gearfinity acts as a construction set, which means modules can be quickly converted from one to another. The demo below shows how the crank module can be converted into a fan module in just a few steps.

## ⚠️ Safety Warning
While Gearfinity is designed for educational and recreational use, it's important to remember that the modules can generate high speeds and/or high torque due to the nature of the planetary gears and moving components.

Please exercise caution when assembling and operating the modules. Here are a few safety tips:

- Always keep your fingers and any loose clothing away from the moving parts to avoid injury.
- Avoid running the modules at high speeds for extended periods as it can lead to wear and potential breakage.
- Gearfinity modules are not toys. They should not be used by children without direct adult supervision.

Remember, safety first! Enjoy your Gearfinity experience responsibly.
