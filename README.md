# Gearfinity Project

Welcome to Gearfinity, your playground for boundless mechanical creations! Gearfinity is a modular and extensible 3D printing project, functioning as a comprehensive engineering kit. With Gearfinity, you can assemble intricate, fully functional mechanical constructs entirely from 3D printed parts – bearings, fasteners, and all. Ready to gear up?

## Getting Started

Your journey into the Gearfinity universe begins with a few essential tools and resources. Here's what you'll need:

1. **A 3D printer**: The cornerstone of your Gearfinity creations.

2. **A hard, flat edge**: Something like a small flathead screwdriver or a knife will come in handy for separating parts.

3. **Wire cutters/snips or needle-nose pliers** (recommended): These tools will be useful for removing (and sometimes inserting) pins.

Once you're equipped, it's time to print your first tool: the [pin tool](https://github.com/gearfinity/gearfinity/blob/main/tools/pin_tool.STL). This is our recommended device for inserting pins seamlessly.

Ready to get your hands dirty with your first module? Meet the [crank module](LINK_TO_CRANK_MODULE) – an excellent starting point for all aspiring Gearfinity builders.
