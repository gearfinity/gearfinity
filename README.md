# Gearfinity Project

Welcome to Gearfinity, your playground for boundless mechanical creations! Gearfinity is a modular and extensible 3D printing project, functioning as a comprehensive engineering kit. With Gearfinity, you can assemble intricate, fully functional mechanical constructs entirely from 3D printed parts – bearings, fasteners, and all. Ready to gear up?

## A Note from the Founder

(not interested? [skip ahead](#getting-started) to get started 😉)

Since I was a kid I've always been fascinated with modular construction sets. From Tinker Toys and Lincoln Logs to Legos and K'nex, I would get lost in the [challenge of building and creating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3P41ri6QZ8). My passion for designing and building later led me into studying robotics and [founding a team to compete in the NASA Lunabotics competition](https://www.alabamaastrobotics.com/) (the team went on to win many years of the competition). Building lunar excavator prototypes introduced me to the power of planetary gears and modular design. Around 2014 I purchased my first 3D printer: the legendary Da Vinci 1.0. I immediately fell in love with 3D printing. In designing robots I had picked up some CAD skills, and now I could almost instantly bring my designs into reality. The possibilities truly seemed endless!

Five years later in 2019 I suddenly became inspired to try to design a 3D printable bubble machine for my kids. I knew I wanted to use planetary gears somehow so I dove into researching what others had designed. I found [lots of cool creations](#acknowledgements), but all of them had something in common that bugged me: they all required extra (non-3D printed) parts. I LOVE the idea of bootstrapping a creation without any external dependencies (NASA calls this [In Situ Resource Utilization or ISRU](https://www.nasa.gov/isru/overview)), so pretty soon I was inspired to create my own 3D printable construction set combining my passion for my childhood toys with the knowledge I had gained from my years with robotics. Thus, Gearfinity was born!

It took a few years of iterating and tinkering but I'm proud to say the Bubble Machine Module is now a functioning reality! (Stay tuned for the official release 😉). Along the way I created several other fun "Modules" and had ideas for many more. I'm thrilled to finally share this project with the world and I hope you find it as fun, educational, and inspiring as I do. Thanks for joining me on this journey!

## Getting Started 🚀

Your journey into the Gearfinity universe begins with a few essential tools and resources. Here's what you'll need:

1. **A 3D printer**: The cornerstone of your Gearfinity creations.

2. **A hard, flat edge**: Something like a small flathead screwdriver or a knife will come in handy for separating parts.

3. **Wire cutters/snips or needle-nose pliers** (recommended): These tools will be useful for removing (and sometimes inserting) pins.

Once you're equipped, it's time to print your first tool: the [pin tool](https://github.com/gearfinity/gearfinity/blob/main/tools/pin_tool.STL). This is our recommended device for inserting pins seamlessly.

In Gearfinity, a 'module' refers to a specific configuration of components that together form a fully functioning mechanism. Each module incorporates various Gearfinity parts (i.e. components) in a way that showcases a distinct mechanical function or interaction.

Ready to get your hands dirty with your first module? Meet the [crank module](https://github.com/gearfinity/gearfinity/blob/main/crank_module/README.md) – an excellent starting point for all aspiring Gearfinity builders. This module is meant to showcase some of the core features of Gearfinity in a simple way, so check it out!

</p>

Remember, patience is key when it comes to assembly. So, take your time, enjoy the process, and watch as your mechanical masterpiece comes to life!

## Safety Warning ⚠️
While Gearfinity is designed for educational and recreational use, it's important to remember that the modules can generate high speeds and/or high torque due to the nature of the planetary gears and moving components.

Please exercise caution when assembling and operating the modules. Here are a few safety tips:

- Always keep your fingers and any loose clothing away from the moving parts to avoid injury.
- Avoid running the modules at high speeds for extended periods as it can lead to wear and potential breakage.
- Gearfinity modules are not toys. They should not be used by children without direct adult supervision.

Remember, safety first! Enjoy your Gearfinity experience responsibly.
