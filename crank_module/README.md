This simple yet comprehensive model offers a hands-on exploration of some core Gearfinity components. By building the Crank Module, you'll get to understand:

- How the unique **fasteners/pins** function in assembling complex structures.
- How **planetary gear modules** integrate seamlessly with each other to form efficient gear systems.
- How various **input and output components** can interface with the planetary gear stages to bring about mechanical motion.

An assembly video will soon be available on YouTube to guide you through each step of the assembly process. Stay tuned!
