This simple yet comprehensive model offers a hands-on exploration of some core Gearfinity components. By building the Crank Module, you'll get to understand:

- How the unique **fasteners/pins** function in assembling complex structures.
- How **planetary gear modules** integrate seamlessly with each other to form efficient gear systems.
- How various **input and output components** can interface with the planetary gear stages to bring about mechanical motion.

Start off by learning how to build planetary gear stages: [Planetary Gear Stage Assembly Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IewrQ3KnOlo)

Then check out this video to guide you through each step of the crank module assembly process: [Crank Module Assembly Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEJv3zD0lIk)

While the Crank Module is an excellent starting point, it's just the beginning of what Gearfinity has to offer.
