- First, open an issue describing what you want to do. We can discuss it together and agree on the best way to implement it before you start the work.
- If you're proposing changes to 3D models, please ensure you've tested the models extensively before submitting a pull request.

## Submitting Changes

Once your changes are ready, you can submit them for review:

- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
- Make your changes in your branch. If you're updating a model, make sure the new model is tested and working.
