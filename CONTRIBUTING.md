# Contributing to Gearfinity

Firstly, thank you for your interest in contributing to Gearfinity! Whether you're fixing an issue, proposing a new feature, or updating documentation, we greatly value your contribution.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Gearfinity. These are not hard-and-fast rules, but rather a guide to help make the contribution process smooth and effective.

## Reporting Issues

We appreciate your help in uncovering and fixing issues. If you find an issue, please submit an issue and follow these guidelines:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue.
- Describe the steps to reproduce the issue. Be as detailed as possible.
- Explain the behavior you observed after following the steps and why it's not what you expected.

## Proposing Changes

If you're thinking about making a change to Gearfinity, such as adjusting a model or adding a new feature, we suggest you to do the following:

- First, open an issue describing what you want to do. We can discuss it together and agree on the best way to implement it before you start the work.
- If you're proposing changes to 3D models, please ensure you've tested the models extensively before submitting a pull request.

## Submitting Changes

Once your changes are ready, you can submit them for review:

- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
- Make your changes in your branch. If you're updating a model, make sure the new model is tested and working.
- Once you're done with your changes, submit a pull request.

## Pull Request Process

After you submit your pull request, we'll review your contribution. We might ask for changes to ensure everything fits well within the Gearfinity ecosystem. 

## Style Guidelines

- Please ensure any 3D models you submit are optimized and have been checked for issues (like non-manifold edges, flipped normals, etc).
- Keep your commit messages clear and descriptive.

## Design Guidelines
- Reuse existing Gearfinity parts when possible, especially large parts.
- If a parts need to be adjusted to fit specs, try adjusting smaller parts first (such as spacers) to avoid creating new variations of a large part.
- Aim to design parts as easy as possible to print. This includes adding built-in supports where necessary.

## Community

If you have questions, feel free to ask. Our community is welcoming and helpful. Remember to be respectful and considerate.
